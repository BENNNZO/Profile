                    <li>Hello! my name is Benjamin Phillips, and I am an 18-year-old who is eager to become a full-stack web developer. I have recently finished a six month development bootcamp with Georgia Tech and have moved on to freelancing, but untimatly I would like to have a full-time job doing full stack web development.</li>
                    <li>I have always been fascinated by computers, and at the age of 12, I had already bought my first computer. Since then, I have grown to have many hobbies, including 3D modeling, graphic design, and video editing, but ultimately decided to pursue computer science. Because of my interest in computers from a young age, I have always been able to learn technology very quickly and excel in the technologies I study.</li>
